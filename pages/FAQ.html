  <h4>Turn off Automatic downloads</h4>
  <h5>Normally, Google Chrome asks for confirmation when a site tries automatically to download files in succession. However, if you want to block all attempts regardless of the site, or maybe you would rather blacklist a specific website. Sometimes when you download a file in a browser, the website will try to download another file immediately after the first finishes. While there are legitimate circumstances---like a file conversion site---there are sites who used it maliciously to force virus or harmful scripts to download without your knowledge or permission. However, for security reasons, Google Chrome now prompts you when a website tries to download multiple files. Best if you blow automatic downloads when connecting onto a website.</h5>
